## Project Overview

This project implements a fully functional contact form with the following features:
- Input fields for **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email**, and **Message**.
- **Radio buttons** for selecting the type of query (General Inquiry or Support Request).
- A **checkbox** for consent to be contacted.
- A **Submit** button that triggers the success message upon form submission.

The solution is built with HTML and styled using CSS.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: The form adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Validation**: Form fields are required, indicated by asterisks (`*`). A real-world project would add additional validation logic for better UX.
- **Success message**: Upon form submission, a success message appears to confirm the form was sent.
- **CSS Styles**: Simple and clean layout with clear input sections and labels for better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the contact form.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for layout, form controls, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: For handling form submission and success message display (if applicable).
